**A Simple Budgeting App Using Javascript**

This is a simple budgeting app that allows a user to input their monthly income and expenditure.

They can also add or delete items if a mistake has been made.

This project allowed me to work on:

* Objects
* Functions
* Arrays
* DOM manipulation

plus how to approach and solve programs and make the different pieces fit together with structure and function creation etc.
